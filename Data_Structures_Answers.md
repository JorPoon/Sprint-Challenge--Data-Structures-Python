Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

O(1) because the item append is only one at a time or fixed amount at a time.

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

O(1) because there is a fixed amount of capacity

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(n) it contains a for loop that depends on the capacity of the data structure

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
